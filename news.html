            Familiar Places is a solo exhibition featuring the work of emerging artist Kim Marra. This two part event will feature both a window installation and an exhibition in the interior. Viewers will approach the space and encounter large scale translucent prints, serving as a lens to the paintings on display behind them. The inside of the space will feature paintings of the same collection.

            Through her paintings, Marra constructs environments. She builds abstract spaces with skewed perspectives that feel like they could exist in reality using elements of architecture. Her environments speak to both dreamlike worlds and industrial landscapes. These colorful paintings explore the themes of home, comfort, and instability in a unique and inviting way. Many of these paintings are created with acrylic paint on mounted wallpaper. This particular medium further explores the concept of home and the rejection of traditional domesticity.
